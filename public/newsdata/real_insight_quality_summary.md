## Real Snapshot Ratchet Gate

- Status: **FAIL**
- Gate version: `real-insight-snapshot-ratchet-v1`
- Grade: `C`
- Score: `76`
- Parents: `10`
- Average angles: `1.5`
- Average temporal tiers: `1.7`
- Average evolution roles: `1.9`
- Base report share: `0.15`
- Multi-angle parents: `5`
- Top parent angles: `2`
- Top parent children: `2`

### Failed gates

- **Average temporal tier count** — actual `1.7`, required `>= 1.8`. Fix: C+E output should cover multiple event-time tiers, not only source buckets.

### Passed gates

- Real snapshot grade floor: `C` / `A/B/C`
- Parent cluster count: `10` / `>= 3`
- Average visible angle count: `1.5` / `>= 1.4`
- Average evolution role count: `1.9` / `>= 1.6`
- Base report share: `0.15` / `<= 0.55`
- Multi-angle parent count: `5` / `>= 1`
- Top parent angle count: `2` / `>= 2`
- Top parent child depth: `2` / `>= 2`
- Weak parent ratio: `0` / `<= 0.5`
